# Rocket Δv Calculator

A tiny **C** program that lets you calculate the total Δv (delta-V) of a multistage launch vehicle.  
For each stage you enter:

1. The number of propellant containers of every size.
2. The number of active thrusters of every size.
3. The total spacecraft mass **at the start** of that stage.

The program then:

- Computes the average specific impulse (Isp) of the stage from your thruster mix.  
- Calculates the stage’s Δv using the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.  
- Adds that Δv to a running mission total.  
- Asks if you want to add another stage.
